# Research direction
Summarizing research direction and project proposals guided by some overarching principles.

## Principles
1. Fail forward. As long as I'm learning, I'm not failing.
2. The topic should matter to me personally.
3. Define the topic first, then find the appropriate technique to apply. Watch out for [bias towards familiar techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument).
4. Prefer fundamental research over incremental improvements. Don't compromise on research risk. 
5. Always consider long-term impact of a research topic.

> "If it is a problem you expect to see solved soon by the community, it is probably not a line of research worth your time in the first place." ([Vincent Vanhoucke](https://medium.com/s/story/so-you-want-to-be-a-research-scientist-363c075d3d4c))

5. (Try to operate at a risk level that only research projects can afford.) _principle to be further developed and well-formulated_

## Directions
1. Social good
2. Creativity

## Proposals
### 1. Social good
#### 1.1 Disentangled representations for responsible modeling
Hypthesis: (Predictive) models can help improve quality and speed of service of existing humanitarian organizations. These models should have a firm grasp on the underlying structure of the (part of the) real world they attempt to represent in order to be used in applications responsibly.  

#### 1.2 Data-efficient and incremental learning
Keywords: small amount of data, transfer learning, improve model quality with small number of new data points

### 2. Creativity
