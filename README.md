# Research direction
Summarizing research direction and project proposals guided by some overarching principles.

## Principles
0. Fail forward. As long as I'm learning, I'm not failing.
1. The topic should matter to me personally.
2. Define the topic first, then find the appropriate technique to apply. Watch out for [bias towards familiar techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument).
3. Prefer fundamental research over incremental improvements. Don't compromise on research risk. 

> "If it is a problem you expect to see solved soon by the community, it is probably not a line of research worth your time in the first place." ([Vincent Vanhoucke](https://medium.com/s/story/so-you-want-to-be-a-research-scientist-363c075d3d4c))

4. (Try to operate at a risk level that only research projects can afford.) _principle to be further developed and well-formulated_

## Proposals
### 1. Social good

### 2. Creativity
